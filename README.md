# Unhandled JSON Decoding Exception in Dart

This example shows a common error in Dart applications involving asynchronous HTTP requests and JSON decoding. The code attempts to access specific fields from a JSON response without properly handling cases where the response might be malformed or missing expected fields.  This can lead to runtime exceptions and application crashes.

The `bug.dart` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.dart` file demonstrates a more robust solution.

This is an example of unexpected data structure issues and how to handle them gracefully, avoiding crashes and unexpected behavior.
